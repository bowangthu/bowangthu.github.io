Short Bio
==
Now, I’m an assistant professor at Tsinghua University. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University working with Prof. [Jianping Wu](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4003.htm) during July 2019 - October 2021. In June 2019, I received my Ph.D. in computer science and technology from the Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. [Fengyuan Ren](http://nns.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/personal/renfy/renfy.html). I received my B.S. from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.

I'm actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D., master, and undergraduate students! Please contact me if you are interested.
